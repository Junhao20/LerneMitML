## Introduction of this file:

Just a quick start, me and Fred, one of my best friend in GW, planed to build an AI, specifically can be used to provide math tutorials for college students. For classes like introduction in statistics, calculus, differential equations and so on. We do have several goals here: 
- Provide the most accurate
- Provide step by step solution for free
- Allowing interactions between users
- Able to generate sample questions
- Able to create an AI tutor, and generate a video on each question

This is our first thought, anything could be changed in the future, wish the best of luck for us.
